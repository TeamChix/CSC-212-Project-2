README for initial design 1
-----------------------------------

Initial design 1 used the current University of Rochester design to launch
some concept pages for displaying the availability of rooms on campus during
room selection.

The 3 designs used d3 for a variety of visualizations.
Campus areas, building, room type and count were provided.

Remaining rooms were visualized using a stacked barchart, zoomable bubble
chart and zoomable treemap

Clone the repository TeamChix/CSC-212-Project-2.
Initial design 1 may be run using the python environment, webpy needs to be
installed.

From the CSC-212-Project-2/Initial_Design_Concepts/Design_1/Project2/src
directory open a python shell.
Execute the following:
>> project2.py

This will start a local web server at localhost:8080 (or http://0.0.0.0:8080/
on the MAC if localhost is not defined).
